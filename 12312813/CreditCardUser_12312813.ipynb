    "Credit card users have the following business requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Credit card bill inquiry\n",
    "- Credit card borrowing and repayment\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit card users are assigned a fixed `user_id` when created to distinguish between different users. There are three credit card user levels: Normal, VIIP, and SVIP. Their `credit_limit` is set at 1000, 10000, and 100000, respectively. `credit_limit` is used to limit the maximum amount for each loan. It is stipulated that credit card users can borrow directly after the initial creation. Subsequent borrowings can only be made after the previous borrowing has been fully repaid. Additionally, users are required to repay all loans at once. If the previous loan is not fully repaid before the next borrowing, credit points will be deducted. The formula for calculating the deducted credit points is as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{deducted} = 3 N_b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $C_{deducted}$ is the deducted credit points, and $N_b$ is the number of days between the two borrowings.\n",
    "\n",
    "When repaying, users will be rewarded with some credit points according to the following formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "C_{reward} = \\left\\{\n",
    "\t\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\t\t365 - N_r & , & N_r < 365 \\\\\n",
    "\t\t0 & , & N_r \\geq 365\n",
    "\t\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\t\\right.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $C_{reward}$ is the rewarded credit points, and $N_r$ is the number of days between repayment and borrowing.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, if a user's credit points are less than 200, they will be unable to borrow further. Each user initially has 1000 credit points."
